forecasting.py - Forcasted the UnitPrice
Proprocessed data:
train.csv - Training data
test.csv - Testing data


Summary of steps performed:
Preprocessing:
1. Imported required libraries.
2. Explored the data like shape,data types,column names.
3. Performed Univariate analysis-
	3.1 For numeric variables checked skewness,variance,histogram,correaltion
	3.2 InvoiceDate started at 2010-12-01 and ended at 2011-12-09.
	3.3 For categorical data plotted bar plot and found who are top. 
4. Checked Missing values percentage and dropped the rows.
5. Performed Bivariate analysis-
	5.1 Ploted the data for one variable with respective to another.
	5.2 Checked multi-collinearity
6. Feature Engineering
	6.1 Created new variable from invoice number starts with C.
	6.2 Added new date fields
	6.3 Identified highly influence Customers who contributed 50 percentile from all the Customers.
7. Splited the data into training and testing on InvoiceDate
	7.1 Considered 2010-12 to 2011-08 for Training.
	7.2  Considered 2011-09 to 2011-12 for Testing.
8. Saved the Train and Test datasets.

ML model:
1. Loaded the train and test data 
2. Build Random Forest Regressor with RMSE - 52.73672973747685.
3. Tried Random Search to get optimal parameters.

Forecasting:
1. Considered only UnitPrice , InvoiceDate columns and aggregated with day-wise.
2. Replaced with 0 where the few dates have no UnitPrice.
3. Ploting the data
4. Checked the time series by ExponentialSmoothing model and rmse is 2.3242101442477607
5. Expored the Time series with 3 terms - Seasonality,Trend,noise
6. Got the optimal p,d,q values. ARIMA(0, 1, 1)x(0, 1, 1, 12)12 - AIC:1455.0565804796659
7. Build SARIMA - seasonal ARIMA model with rmse value 1.827147370401409
8. Tried with different p,d,q values like trail and error
9. Also got the optimal p,q values from ACF,PACF plots.
10. Build Auto amria.
